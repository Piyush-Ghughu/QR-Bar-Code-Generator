                <p>A QR code (quick response code) is a type of two dimensional (2D) bar code that is used to provide
                    easy access to online information through the digital camera on a smartphone or tablet.A barcode
                    reader in the camera interprets the bar code, which typically contains a link to view a webpage,
                    send an SMS text message or call a phone number. The technology for QR codes was developed by
                    Densa-Wave, a Toyota subsidiary. The codes were originally used for tracking inventory and required
                    a separate reader app, but beginning with iOS 11 and Android 8.0, readers are native to most mobile
                    device cameras.tatic QR codes, like the one above, are typically used to disseminate information to
                    the general public. They are often displayed on posters and billboards and in ads in newspapers and
                    magazines. The person who created the code can track information about the number of times their
                    code was scanned and whether or not the code's call to action was taken.Dynamic QR codes (sometimes
                    referred to as unique QR codes) offer more functionality. They can be edited at any time and even
                    target a specific individual for personalized marketing. Such codes contain more metadata to
                    facilitate tracking.</p>

                <p>barcode, a printed series of parallel bars or lines of varying width that is used for entering data
                    into a computer system. The bars are typically black on a white background, and their width and
                    quantity vary according to application. The bars are used to represent the binary digits 0 and 1,
                    sequences of which in turn can represent numbers from 0 to 9 and be processed by a digital computer.
                    The presence or absence of a bar of a particular width in a particular position in a sequence is
                    read by the computer as either a 0 or 1. Most such codes use bars of only two different widths
                    (thick and thin), though some codes employ four widths. The numbers represented by a barcode are
                    also printed out at its base.Barcode information is read by an optical (laser) scanner that is part
                    of a computer system. In the UPC system, the five digits on
                    the left are assigned to a particular manufacturer or maker, and the five digits on the right are
                    used by that manufacturer to identify a specific type or make of product. This is usually the only
                    information contained in a barcode.</p>
